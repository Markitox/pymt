Welcome to PyMT's documentation!
================================

PyMT is a Python library for developing NUI (new user interfaces, including
multi-touch) enabled media rich applications.

The goal of PyMT is to provide a framework for quick and easy interaction
design with a focus on rapid prototype development.

There is also a focus on logging tasks and sessions of user interaction to
quantify data and allow the analysis and visualization of such data.

Programming Guide of PyMT
-------------------------

In order to understand PyMT, you must first understand the underlying libraries
that have been used to create it. The programming guide contains a basic
introduction to each of these libraries, in addition to a few unique systems
created specifically for PyMT.

You can access to the Programming Guide on the Wiki :
