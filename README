Introduction
------------

PyMT is a python module for developing multi-touch enabled media rich
applications. Currently the aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction
design and rapid prototype development.

PyMT is written in python, based on pyglet toolkit.


Installation
------------

Run the setup script as follows to install pymt systemwide for python:

  python setup.py install


Dependencies
------------

  * python (>= 2.5, < 3.0) - http://python.org
  * pyglet (>= 1.1.2) - http://www.pyglet.org
  * csound (audio, optional) - http://www.csound.com
  * ounk (audio, optional) - http://code.google.com/p/ounk/
  * avbin (video, optional) - http://code.google.com/p/avbin/


Dcoumentation, Examples & Tutorials
-----------------------------------

There is an API reference included in doc/build/html/.
There is some simple example apps in the examples folder that should get
you started for now.

Configuration
-------------

  [pymt]

  # show/hide fps
  show_fps = (0|1)

  # display event stats at end
  show_eventstats = (0|1)

  # set log level
  log_level = (debug|info|warning|error|critical)

  # detection time of double tap
  double_tap_time = <integer>

  # max distance allowed for double tap
  double_tap_distance = <integer>

  [graphics]

  # activate fullscreen
  fullscreen = (0|1)

  # width of window
  width = <integer>

  # height of window
  height = <integer>

  # force vsync
  vsync = (0|1)

  # force fbo type
  fbo = (hardware|software)

  [tuio]

  # listening ip
  host = <ip>

  # listening port
  port = <integer>

  # ignore list
  ignore = [(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax), ...]

  [dump]

  # activate record of frames
  enabled = (0|1)

  # prefix to use for dump
  prefix = <string>

  # format of dump image
  format = <jpeg|png>



Other python/MT resources
-------------------------

touchpy.googlecode.com
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the code for pymt (Tuio2DCursor class and some parsing) is taken
from touchpy. Touchpy provides a slightly different event model
(I think it is agnostic as to what windowing libraries you want to use).

pyglet.org
^^^^^^^^^^

PyMT is for use with pyglet only at the moment. It provides MT events in
a way that is consistent to other pyglet events (the pyglet team has a
great section about their event system in their documentaion)

nuigroup.com

natural user interfaces.
