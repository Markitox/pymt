About:
   This is very early alpha, so keep in mind that it might not work as intended at all times.
   For bug reports, feature requests and other issues please contact thomas.hansen@gmail.com
   or stop by #pymt on freenode.org


Installation:
  run the setup script as follows to install pymt systemwide for python:
    'python setup.py install'


Dependencies:
   python (2.6 recommended, not 3.0 compatible)
   pyglet (for video support you need avbin)
     you will need pyglet (www.pyglet.org) and will probably want to take a look at the pyglet
     documentation since pymt is built on top of pyglet dealing with multi touch events.

   for sound apps using csound:
     ounk
     csound


Dcoumentation, Examples & Tutorials
   There is an API refernece included in the trunk under the doc folder.
   There is some simple example apps in the examples folder that should get you started for now.


Other python/MT resources:
   *touchpy.googlecode.com
        Some of the code for pymt (Tuio2DCursor class and some parsing) is taken from touchpy (touchpy.googlecode.com).
        touchpy provides a slightly different event model (I think it is agnostic as to what windowing libraries you want to use).

   *pyglet.org
      pymt is for use with pyglet only at the moment.  It provides MT events in a way that is consistent to other pyglet events (
      the pyglet team has a great section about their event system in their documentaion)
